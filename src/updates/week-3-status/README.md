## Updated Status on Issues Previously Reported
- **Temperature range:** We decided to choose the range of 0-70 degrees for ease of requirements
  - Expecting to excel with as wide a margin over the minimum range as possible
- **Height/aspect ratio:** We spoke with the customer and instead of having a height requirement, to go with a tabletop set up
- **Data output method:** We spoke with the customer, and it doesn't matter how we save our data, leaving the requirement broad so that we could make adjustments further down the road
  - Departure from original customer requirement to specifically use a text file. Final requirements will only include generic data output.

## Issues Needing Resolving
- N/A at this time

## Project Notes
