# Week 11 Status Report

## Completed This Week
- Weekly Meeting (11-13-25)

### Individual Contributions

**Nik (Chief Analyst):**
- Worked on main PCB board in KiCAD
- Discussed design ideas for overall chamber structure

**Alex (Program Lead):**
- Setup Onshape for 3D modeling collaboration
- Worked on individual subsystem report
- Brainstormed design ideas

**Lexi (Project Engineer):**
- Discussed design ideas
- Started drafting Subsystem Report
- Setup Onshape

**Jacob (Chief Test Engineer):**
- Familiarization with laser cutter as prospective prototyping machine
- 3D modeling of parts
- Setup Onshape

**Joe (System Engineer):**
- Ordered Fluid Transfer Tools
- Setup Onshape
- RFA Work (sections 1 and 2)

## Next Week Plans
- PDR RFA completion and submittal to Prof. McInnis
- Individual Subsystem Design Reports and associated documents
- Ongoing trade studies in designs
- Further development with 3D model of parts
- Further group familiarization with prototyping methods
- Preparation for fluid recovery

## Updated Status on Issues Previously Reported
- **Resolved:** Established Onshape as online program for cross-functional collaboration on project 3D modeling

## Issues Needing Resolving
- **Establishing more meeting times** (whether all members can attend or not; whether online or in-person) for the group to stay on schedule, discuss project ideas, and collaborate on existing tasks
- **Ensuring everyone is informed** on what each member is tasked with, and what the other members accomplished towards the project to maintain updates

## Project Notes
This week marked a significant shift toward design and prototyping work. The team established Onshape as the collaborative 3D modeling platform, enabling cross-functional design work. Multiple team members began 3D modeling parts and familiarizing themselves with prototyping tools like the laser cutter. The focus is now on completing the PDR RFA and individual subsystem reports while advancing design work through trade studies and 3D modeling.
