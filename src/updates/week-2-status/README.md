# Week 2 Status Report

## Completed This Week
- Research on individual and collective technical questions for project
- Chosen individual roles for the project
- ConOps begun (system requirements, risks, operation description, etc.)
- Project Schedule begun

## Next Week Plans
- ConOps completion
- SRR draft completion

## Updated Status on Issues Previously Reported
- N/A

## Issues Needing Resolving
- **Deciding temperature range** (required or optional) we want to target
- **Customer Question: Preference on height/aspect ratio?**
  - We want to know what the preferred or desired height will be. If a very high aspect ratio is desired (like a VCR slot) or a more generic box shape
- **Customer Question: File saving or serial**
  - Most commercial units output regular and stamped data via serial, this is easier to implement and puts the burden of recording on the operator

## Project Notes
This week focused on establishing team structure and beginning the foundational documentation process. The team has identified key technical questions that need customer input to proceed with detailed design decisions.
